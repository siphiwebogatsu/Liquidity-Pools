# Liquidity Pools and Decentralized Finance on Algorand Blockchain
A liquidity pool is a collection of digital assets that are pooled together to enable trading on a decentralized exchange (DEX). Liquidity pools are created when users lock their cryptocurrency into smart contracts or crypto accounts, which in turn enables the tokens to be used by traders. A DEX does not rely on a third party to hold users' funds - DEX users transact with each other directly, and as a results they require more liquidity than centralized exchanges (CEXs) because they don't have the same mechanisms in place to match buyers and sellers. In exchange for their services, liquidity providers (LPs) earn a percentage of transaction fees for each trade that is executed.

Here I demonstrate the following on a CLI:
- Liquidity providers providing the ALGO cryptocurrency and UCTZAR stablecoin (created in the previous question) to a liquidity pool (ALGO/UCTZAR trading pair).
- Liquidity providers receiving corresponding liquidity pool tokens after locking their funds in the pool (i.e. staking).
- Traders trading ALGOs for UCTZAR.
- Traders trading UCTZAR for ALGOs.
- Liquidity providers receiving a portion of trade fees i.e. liquidity providers get incentives
- Liquidity providers surrendering their liquidity pool tokens and withdrawing their locked funds
